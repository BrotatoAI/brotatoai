WARNING: Could not recover 737 keys for translation.csv
Saved translations.csv to res://.assets/resources/translations/translations.csv

-------
The following addons failed to have their libraries copied or plugin.cfg regenerated:
- mod_loader
- JSON_Schema_Validator
You may encounter editor errors due to this.
Tip: Try finding the plugin in the Godot Asset Library or Github.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Godot editor version 3.5.3 to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
